Welcome to OpenLabelPrint (c) Xyratex 2011

Printing System for end-to-end printing open standard SVG artwork exported from Illustrator, Corel, Inkscape or other SVG tools, directly onto manufactured products with variable data such as barcodes. Supports Zebra label printing via ZPL language.

To understand the overall concept, have a look in the docs folder, starting with the overview. 

This shows why OpenLabelPrint is unique in the label printing industry, as while it supports printing artwork with variable data using printers made by market leader Zebra, it does not tie you to a closed proprietary drawing format like other label print software does, instead OpenLabelPrint uses the W3C Open Standard of SVG, Scaleable Vector Graphics, an XML format exported by leading drawing packages such as Illustrator and Corel. This means that labels are printed as the artists and designers intended without re-interpretation/reworking inbetween to convert to a proprietary label printing format!
